# docrails_kindle

This gem lets you generate a Kindle version of the [Ruby on Rails Guides][railsguide] with 
working section and article navigation.

[railsguide]:http://guides.rubyonrails.org/

## Download Guide

If you just want to download the ebook I generated with this tool, here it is:

[Rails Guides]:https://github.com/danchoi/docrails_kindle/raw/master/mobi/rails-guide.2012-01-18.mobi



To generate the Rails Guides ebook yourself, read on. 



## Install

    gem install docrails_kindle

## Prerequisistes

Download [KindleGen 2][kindlegen] and put it on your PATH.

[kindlegen]:http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621

## How to use

    gem install railsguides_kindle
    git clone git@github.com:lifo/docrails.git
    cd docrails/railties/guides
    KINDLE=1 rake generate_guides
    cd output/kindle
    docrails_kindle
    
The output document will be called something like
`rails-guide.2012-11-18.mobi`. Don't confuse it with the other mobi document
that gets generated by `rake genereate_guides`, which looks like
`ruby_on_rails_guides_16c5f48.mobi`.
  
You can transfer this mobi file to your Kindle.


## Contribute

This program is a rough prototype. Some internal links may not work. Other
defects in the resulting ebook may exist. Please file issues.

Also, if the `docsrails` team would like to incorporate this into their
`rake` tasks code, please take and modify my code as you see fit.
