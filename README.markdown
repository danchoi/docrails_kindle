# docrails_kindle

This gem lets you generate a Kindle version of the [Ruby on Rails
Guides][railsguide] with working section and article navigation.

[railsguide]:http://guides.rubyonrails.org/

The DocRails project does provide its own experimental Rake task to generate a
Kindle version of the Rails Guides. However, its new section and article
navigation doesn't work correctly.

## Download Guide

If you just want to download the ebook I generated with this tool, here it is:

[Download Rails Guides ebook][mobi]

[mobi]:https://github.com/danchoi/docrails_kindle/raw/master/mobi/rails-guide.2012-01-18.mobi

But to keep up with updates to the Rails Guides, you may want to periodically
generate the Rails Guides ebook yourself. For this, please read on.


## Install

    gem install docrails_kindle

## Prerequisistes

Download [KindleGen 2][kindlegen] and put it on your PATH.

[kindlegen]:http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621

## How to use

    gem install railsguides_kindle
    git clone git@github.com:lifo/docrails.git
    cd docrails/railties/guides
    KINDLE=1 rake generate_guides
    cd output/kindle
    docrails_kindle
    
The output document will be called something like
`rails-guide.2012-11-18.mobi`. Don't confuse it with the other mobi document
that gets generated by `rake genereate_guides`, which looks like
`ruby_on_rails_guides_16c5f48.mobi`.
  
You can transfer this mobi file to your Kindle.


## Contribute

This program is a rough prototype. Some internal links may not work. The css
styling may need to be improved. Other bugs may exist. Please file issues or
fork and submit pull requests.

Also, if the DocsRails team would like to incorporate and adapt this code for
their project, please go for it.
